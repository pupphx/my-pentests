- The ‘Decryptor.py’ and ‘Encryptor.py’ Files are present in both folders for easy access when       
pen testing the fake files, or using the standalone scripts.

- The Encryptor can only encrypt the files in its own directory, and cannot open others.

- I plan to make a more advanced one soon that can encrypt anything on the system it was placed on.

- The fake files is all of made up stuff to test the encryptor.
